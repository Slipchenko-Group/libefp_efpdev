\mainpage The Effective Fragment Potential method implementation

\par Introduction

<i>LIBEFP</i> is a full implementation of the Effective Fragment Potential (EFP)
method (see <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/cr200093j">
<i>Gordon et al., Chem. Rev., 2012</i></a>).
<i>LIBEFP</i> is designed to give developers of quantum chemistry software an
easy way to add EFP support to their favourite package.

\par EFPMD molecular simulation package

<a href="http://github.com/libefp/libefp/tree/master/efpmd"><i>EFPMD</i></a>
is a molecular simulation package based on <i>LIBEFP</i>. Its main features include:

 - Single point energy and analytical gradient calculation

 - Geometry optimization using efficient LBFGS optimizer

 - Molecular dynamics in microcanonical (NVE), canonical (NVT), and
isobaric-isothermal (NPT) ensembles

 - Seminumerical Hessian and normal mode analysis

 - Simulation of periodic systems

 - Parallelization of calculations on multi-core machines

 - Very simple input format

The Effective Fragment Potential method is much more accurate than traditional
force-field based methods. For example it was shown that the EFP method
accurately predicts structures and binding energies in the water-benzene
complexes which is a challenge for many computational methods (see <a
href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jp808845b"><i>Slipchenko et al., J. Phys. Chem.
A, 2009</i></a>). Thus <i>EFPMD</i> is one of the best tools for high-accuracy
modeling of solid state and liquid molecular systems.

<i>EFPMD</i> is a part of <i>LIBEFP</i> distribution and is compiled by default
when you build <i>LIBEFP</i>. See
<a href="http://github.com/libefp/libefp/tree/master/efpmd/README.md"><i>README</i></a>
file for more information on how to use the package.

\par Library users

<i>LIBEFP</i> is currently used in
<a href="http://www.psicode.org/"><i>PSI</i></a>
(development version) and
<a href="http://github.com/libefp/libefp/tree/master/efpmd"><i>EFPMD</i></a>
packages.

\par Documentation

Documentation for public <i>LIBEFP</i> API is available
<a href="efp_8h.html"><i>here</i></a>.
For installation instructions and additional information see
<a href="http://github.com/libefp/libefp/blob/master/README.md"><i>README</i></a>
file.

\par Parallel performance

<i>LIBEFP</i> is parallelized using
<a href="http://www.openmp.org/"><i>OpenMP</i></a> to utilize the full power
of multi-core CPUs. Below is the plot of achieved parallel speedup in a
single point energy computation test with a system containing 3375 EFP water
molecules. The test was performed using
<a href="http://github.com/libefp/libefp/tree/master/efpmd"><i>EFPMD</i></a>
program on a machine with two Intel Xeon X5667 CPUs.
